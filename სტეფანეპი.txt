What is the black hole?

According to the theory of relativity, nothing can travel faster than light. Thus if light cannot escape, neither can anything
else; everything is dragged back by the gravitational field. So one has a set of events, a region of space-time, from
which it is not possible to escape to reach a distant observer. This region is what we now call a black hole.

Can we go back in time? 

A possible way to explain the absence of visitors from the future would be to say that the past is fixed because
we have observed it and seen that it does not have the kind of warping needed to allow travel back from the
future. On the other hand, the future is unknown and open, so it might well have the curvature required. This
would mean that any time travel would be confined to the future. There would be no chance of Captain Kirk and
the Starship Enterprise turning up at the present time.

What is the universe?

Today scientists describe the universe in terms of two basic partial theories – the general theory of relativity
and quantum mechanics. They are the great intellectual achievements of the first half of this century

What is the general theory of relativity?

The general theory of relativity describes the force of gravity and the large-scale structure of the universe, that is,
the structure on scales from only a few miles to as large as a million million million million (1 with twenty-four
zeros after it) miles, the size of the observable universe.

What is the quantum mechanics?

Quantum mechanics deals with phenomena on extremely small scales, such as a millionth of a millionth of an inch. 

What is the Hawking radiation?

In fact, black holes should thermally create and emit sub-atomic particles,
which I called a radiation, until they exhaust their energy and evaporate completely. 
According to this theory, black holes are not completely black, and neither do they last forever.

What is the big bang theory?

The Big Bang Theory is the leading explanation about how the universe began. 
At its simplest, it says the universe as we know it started with a small singularity,
then inflated over the next 13.8 billion years to the cosmos that we know today.

What is the time?

Ask Einstein.

Can you tell us your story which can inspire us?

Became clear something was not quite right with me, I fell over and had great difficulty getting up again.
My mother realized something was wrong and took me to the doctor.I spent weeks in Bart's Hosptal and had many tets.
They never actually told me what was wrong, but I guessed enough to know it was pretty bad. 
In fact, the doctor who diagnosed me wahsed his hands of me and I never saw him again. He felt that there was nothing
that could be done and first I became depressed, I seemed to be getting wors pretty rapidly.
There didn't seem any point working on my PhD, because I did not know if I live long enough to finish it.
I had come to Cambridge to do cosmology, and cosmology I was determined to do. Then the condition
developed more slowly, and I began to make progrees in my work. After my expectations had been reduced 
to zero, every new day became a bonus, and I began to appreciate everything I did have. And there was
also a young woman called Jane, whom I had met at party. Getting engaged lifted my spirits, and 
I realized while there's life, there is hope. There are many ambitious experiments planned for the future.
We will map the positions of billions of galaxies, and we will beter undertand our place in the universe.
But we must also continiue  to go into space for the future of humanity. I don't think we will survive
another thousands years without escaping beyond our fragile planet.
It has been a glorius time to be alive, doung research in theoritical physics. The fact that
we humans, who are ourselves mere collections of fundamental particles of nature,
have been able to come this cloe to an understanding of the laws governing us and our universe
is a grea triumph, and I am happy if I have made a small contribution. I want to share my 
excitement and enthusiasm about this quest, so remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. 
Try to make sence of what you see, and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious.
And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do an succeed at. It matters
that you don't just give up. While there's life, there is hope.
